# Multi-User Collaboration Database Schema Design

## Overview

This document outlines the enhanced database schema for advanced multi-user collaboration features in the Asana clone application. The design builds upon the existing foundation and adds sophisticated permission management, document versioning, and workspace organization capabilities.

## Key Features

### 1. Granular Permission System

**Purpose**: Replace simple role-based access with fine-grained permissions that can be customized per user and context.

#### Tables:
- `permissions` - Catalog of all available permissions
- `role_permissions` - Default permissions for each role type
- `custom_permissions` - User-specific permission overrides

#### Permission Categories:
- **Project**: view, edit, delete, manage_members, manage_settings, archive, create_templates
- **Task**: view, create, edit, delete, assign, complete, comment, attach_files  
- **Team**: view, edit, delete, manage_members
- **Workspace**: view, edit, manage_members, create_projects, manage_billing

#### Benefits:
- Flexible permission inheritance with overrides
- Context-aware permissions (project/team/workspace scope)
- Easy permission auditing and management
- Supports complex organizational structures

### 2. Document Versioning System

**Purpose**: Track all changes to tasks and projects with full version history and conflict resolution.

#### Tables:
- `document_versions` - Full snapshots of entity states
- `version_history` - Granular field-level change tracking

#### Features:
- Automatic version creation on entity updates
- Field-level change tracking with old/new values
- User attribution for all changes
- Conflict detection and resolution support
- JSONB storage for flexible content structure

#### Use Cases:
- Collaborative editing with conflict resolution
- Audit trails for compliance
- Undo/redo functionality
- Change review and approval workflows

### 3. Multi-Tenant Workspace Management

**Purpose**: Enable organization-level separation of projects and users with subscription management.

#### Tables:
- `workspaces` - Top-level organizational containers
- `workspace_members` - User membership in workspaces

#### Features:
- Isolated data per workspace
- Subscription tier management
- Workspace-specific settings and branding
- Hierarchical access control (workspace → project → task)
- Billing and usage tracking per workspace

#### Roles:
- **Owner**: Full control including billing and member management
- **Admin**: Manage projects and members (no billing)
- **Member**: Basic workspace access
- **Billing Manager**: Manage subscription and billing only

### 4. Enhanced Existing Tables

#### Projects Table Additions:
- `workspace_id` - Links projects to workspaces for multi-tenancy

#### Benefits:
- Clear data isolation between organizations
- Scalable architecture for enterprise customers
- Flexible workspace configuration

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Tables and Types
1. Create new ENUM types for permissions and roles
2. Create permissions catalog and role mapping tables
3. Create document versioning tables
4. Create workspace management tables

### Phase 2: Helper Functions
1. `user_has_permission()` - Permission checking with inheritance
2. `create_document_version()` - Automated versioning
3. `create_default_workspace()` - User onboarding
4. `anonymize_user_data()` - GDPR compliance

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Update existing application code to use new permission system
2. Implement automatic document versioning triggers
3. Add workspace selection to user interface
4. Migrate existing data to workspace structure

## Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Implement RLS policies based on workspace membership
- Ensure users can only access data from their workspaces
- Custom permission checking in RLS policies

### Data Privacy
- Anonymization functions for user data deletion
- Encrypted storage for sensitive workspace settings
- Audit logging for all permission changes

### Performance Optimization
- Strategic indexes on permission lookup paths
- Efficient workspace filtering queries
- Caching for frequent permission checks

## Migration Strategy

### Existing Data
1. Create default workspace for existing users
2. Migrate existing projects to default workspaces
3. Convert existing role assignments to new permission system
4. Preserve all existing functionality during transition

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain existing API endpoints during transition
- Gradual rollout of new features
- Feature flags for progressive enhancement

## API Integration Points

### Permission Checking
```sql
SELECT user_has_permission(user_id, 'task.edit', 'project', project_id);
```

### Document Versioning
```sql
SELECT create_document_version('task', task_id, task_data, 'Updated description', user_id);
```

### Workspace Management
```sql
SELECT create_default_workspace(user_id, 'Acme Corp Workspace');
```

## Benefits of This Design

1. **Scalability**: Multi-tenant architecture supports enterprise growth
2. **Flexibility**: Granular permissions adapt to any organizational structure  
3. **Compliance**: Full audit trails and data anonymization support
4. **Collaboration**: Document versioning enables conflict-free multi-user editing
5. **Performance**: Strategic indexing and efficient query patterns
6. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular design

## Next Steps

1. Apply the database migration to create new tables and types
2. Implement helper functions for common operations
3. Update application code to use new permission system
4. Add workspace selection to user interface
5. Implement document versioning in task/project editing
6. Add real-time collaboration features using versioning system

This enhanced schema provides a solid foundation for advanced multi-user collaboration while maintaining the simplicity and performance of the existing system.
