The v4 version was requiring @tailwindcss/postcss plugin instead of the direct tailwindcss plugin, causing build failures and preventing styles from being applied. Updated PostCSS configuration to use the standard tailwindcss plugin compatible with v3. Verified all configuration files are correct, including src/index.css with proper @tailwind directives, src/main.tsx with correct CSS imports, tailwind.config.js with appropriate content paths and custom colors, and postcss.config.js with proper plugin configuration for v3. Build and development processes now run successfully without errors (npm run build, npm run dev on localhost:5173).

The main.tsx file correctly imports index.css. Development server runs smoothly on localhost:5174 with hot reload functionality.
