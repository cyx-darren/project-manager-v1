# Task 9.19 Security Audit & Optimization - Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan validates that all security vulnerabilities identified in the security audit have been properly fixed and that the multi-user collaboration features are secure and optimized.

## Pre-Test Setup
- **Application URL**: http://localhost:5173
- **Test User**: darren@easyprintsg.com / Amber12345
- **Environment**: Development with real Supabase backend

## Test Categories

### 1. Authentication & Session Security Tests

#### 1.1 Login Flow Security
- [ ] **Login with valid credentials**
  - Navigate to login page
  - Enter: darren@easyprintsg.com / Amber12345
  - Verify successful authentication
  - Check that no security warnings appear in console

#### 1.2 Session Recovery
- [ ] **Session persistence after page refresh**
  - Login successfully
  - Refresh the page
  - Verify user remains authenticated
  - Check console for session recovery messages (should show success, not temp warnings)

#### 1.3 Permission Service Functionality
- [ ] **Permission service is working (no more bypasses)**
  - Login and navigate to dashboard
  - Check browser console
  - Verify NO messages containing "TEMP: Skipping permission service call"
  - Verify NO messages about "Custom permissions temporarily disabled"

### 2. Permission System Security Tests

#### 2.1 Dashboard Access Control
- [ ] **Dashboard loads without security bypasses**
  - Navigate to /dashboard after login
  - Verify dashboard loads completely
  - Check console for any permission-related errors
  - Verify no infinite recursion warnings

#### 2.2 Project Access Control
- [ ] **Project permissions work correctly**
  - Navigate to projects page
  - Verify projects are visible (user should see projects they have access to)
  - Try accessing a project detail page
  - Verify no RLS recursion errors in console

#### 2.3 Task Management Permissions
- [ ] **Task operations respect permissions**
  - Navigate to a project with tasks
  - Try viewing tasks (should work for project members)
  - Try creating a task (should work based on role)
  - Try editing a task (should work for task creator/project admin)
  - Verify operations work without console errors

### 3. Database Security Tests

#### 3.1 RLS Policy Functionality
- [ ] **No infinite recursion in database queries**
  - Perform various operations (view projects, tasks, create items)
  - Monitor browser console for any database recursion errors
  - Verify no "Circuit breaker" warnings appear repeatedly

#### 3.2 Permission Queries
- [ ] **Database permission functions work safely**
  - Navigate between different sections of the app
  - Verify smooth operation without permission check failures
  - Check that permission checks complete in reasonable time (< 2 seconds)

### 4. Multi-User Collaboration Security

#### 4.1 Project Member Management
- [ ] **Project membership controls work**
  - Navigate to a project settings/team page
  - Verify team members are displayed correctly
  - Check that role-based permissions are enforced

#### 4.2 Activity Logging Security
- [ ] **Activity logs capture user actions securely**
  - Navigate to /activity page (should be accessible)
  - Perform some actions (create/edit tasks)
  - Verify activities are logged with proper user attribution
  - Check that sensitive information is not exposed

### 5. Performance & Optimization Tests

#### 5.1 Page Load Performance
- [ ] **Dashboard loads quickly without blocking**
  - Time dashboard load from login
  - Should load within 3 seconds
  - No hanging permission checks

#### 5.2 Permission Check Optimization
- [ ] **Permission checks are efficient**
  - Navigate through various pages
  - Verify no excessive permission check calls in console
  - Check that caching is working (should see cache hit messages)

### 6. Error Handling & Fallbacks

#### 6.1 Graceful Error Handling
- [ ] **System handles permission errors gracefully**
  - Try accessing restricted areas (if any)
  - Verify appropriate error messages
  - Check that system doesn't crash or show infinite loading

#### 6.2 Circuit Breaker Functionality
- [ ] **Circuit breaker prevents infinite loops**
  - System should operate normally without triggering circuit breaker
  - If circuit breaker is triggered, verify graceful fallback behavior

## Console Log Validation

### Expected Messages (Good):
- âœ… "Global role fetched: [role]"
- âœ… "Session recovered from Supabase: [email]" 
- âœ… "User data processed successfully"
- âœ… "Permission granted via safe database function"

### Unacceptable Messages (Bad):
- ðŸš¨ "TEMP: Skipping permission service call"
- ðŸš¨ "Custom permissions temporarily disabled"
- ðŸš¨ "Circuit breaker triggered" (appearing repeatedly)
- ðŸš¨ "Infinite recursion in RLS policies"

## Success Criteria

### Task 9.19 is COMPLETE when:
1. âœ… All authentication flows work without security bypasses
2. âœ… Permission system is fully functional (no temp disables)
3. âœ… Database queries execute without recursion errors
4. âœ… All core features (dashboard, projects, tasks, activity) are accessible
5. âœ… Performance is optimized (sub-3-second page loads)
6. âœ… Console shows only normal operational messages
7. âœ… Multi-user collaboration features work securely

### Test Coverage
- Authentication: 3 test scenarios
- Permissions: 3 test scenarios  
- Database: 2 test scenarios
- Collaboration: 2 test scenarios
- Performance: 2 test scenarios
- Error Handling: 2 test scenarios

**Total: 14 test scenarios** to validate security audit completion
