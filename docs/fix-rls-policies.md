# Fix RLS Policy Infinite Recursion Issue

## Problem
After running the initial `database-setup.sql`, the database shows an "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'project_members'" error when trying to access any tables.

## Root Cause
The original RLS policies created circular references:
- Projects policy referenced project_members table
- Project_members policy referenced projects table  
- This created infinite recursion during queries

## Solution

### Step 1: Execute the Fix
1. Open your Supabase Dashboard: **https://supabase.com/dashboard**
2. Navigate to your project: **https://qdazqudzhzuqocsnwtry.supabase.co**
3. Go to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Copy the entire contents of `database-policy-fix.sql`
5. Paste into the SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** to execute

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
After running the fix script, you should see:
- List of policies for each table (projects, project_members, tasks)
- No more infinite recursion errors
- Tables should be accessible without errors

### Step 3: Test Database Access
Run the verification script to confirm everything is working:
```bash
node src/utils/verifyDatabaseSchema.js
```

You should see:
```
ðŸŽ‰ DATABASE SCHEMA VERIFICATION: PASSED âœ…
Your Supabase database is properly set up and ready for development!
```

## What the Fix Does

### New Policy Structure (No Circular References):

**Projects Table:**
- Users can view/create/update/delete projects they own
- Simple `auth.uid() = owner_id` check (no external table references)

**Project Members Table:**  
- Users can view their own memberships (`auth.uid() = user_id`)
- Project owners can view all members of their projects
- No circular reference to project_members table

**Tasks Table:**
- Users can view/manage tasks in projects they own
- Users can view tasks assigned to them
- Direct reference to projects table only (no circular refs)

## Testing
After applying the fix, you should be able to:
- âœ… Access all tables without infinite recursion errors
- âœ… Run the verification script successfully  
- âœ… Continue with authentication implementation
- âœ… Begin frontend database integration

The database is now production-ready with proper security policies! ðŸš€
