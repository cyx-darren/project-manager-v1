3. **Invite Users** - Send new invitations with role selection
4. **Role Management** - Manage user roles and permissions

**Permission System Integration:**
- Real-time permission checking and display
- Role-based UI changes (Member vs Admin vs Owner)
- Context-aware permissions (workspace vs project)
- Permission validation for all actions

### 3. Service Integration

#### API Tester Integration
- Added "Show User Management Demo" button (violet colored)
- Integrated with existing demo system
- Proper test data attributes for automation
- Seamless navigation and access

#### Service Exports
- Updated service index to export all user management components
- Proper TypeScript type definitions
- Integration with existing collaboration and workspace services
